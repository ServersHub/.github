- The API has built-in crash logs, which can be located inside "<b>ShooterGame/Saved/Logs/</b>"<br>
- The API has no connection or affiliation with "<b>Wildcard Studios</b>" directly, nor should it ever be considered that "<b>Wildcard Studios</b>" endorses the API. The API is an open-source tool the - community can use to run plugins for their video game servers, similar to how "<b>Minecraft / Rust</b>" and other video games have plugin systems where you can improve the overall health and gameplay of your community servers.<br>
- Please note when installing plugins into the "<b>ARK\ShooterGame\Binaries\Win64\ArkApi\Plugins</b>" folder, you must make sure the "<b>.DLL</b>" plugin name matches the same "<b>folder</b>" name. Changing the folder name to something different or unique will prevent the "<b>.DLL</b>" from reading the folder and preventing it from starting.<br>
